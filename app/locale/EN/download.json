You can download the evaluation data so that you can work on it later. (This is the same as the 'Save' functionality.) <br>The aim of this tool is to generate and download this report.

If you want to download it in HTML format, don't forget to download the report's style sheet (CSS) as well, so that later you can change the report's content and visual design to meet your needs. If you choose to download the report in ODS or XLSX format, only the 'A' and 'AA' level conformity criteria and a maximum of 35 pages will be included in the report (this will not be the case if you choose to download the report in JSON or HTML format).",
