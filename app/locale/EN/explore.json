    "INTRO": "Explore the website to understand its purpose, functionality, and use. This step helps you determine which web pages to use for the evaluation in the next steps. Identify the web technologies used to provide the website and, if you want, take notes on other aspects of the website. Usually it is best to get input from the website owners and developers for this step. More guidance on this step is provided in <a href={{link_em_2}} title='WCAG-EM Step 2: Explore the Website (opens in new window)'>WCAG-EM Step 2: Explore the Website</a>.",

This includes basic web technologies such as HTML and CSS, auxiliary web technologies such as JavaScript and WAI-ARIA, as well as specific web technologies such as SMIL, SVG and PDF. Often, it is also useful to identify the content management system (CMS), version and configuration, as this may be relevant to explaining the results of the evaluation. In addition, the libraries and components used to create the website, such as Dojo, jQuery and others, may be relevant. Particularly for web applications, much of the accessibility support is integrated into libraries and components and evaluation can be more effective and efficient when they are identified. The usefulness of filling in the information here is to facilitate the sample selection process, as well as to see consistency in the evaluation results.
